I want to use my projects as my portfolio to showcase my skills and potential as a frontend developer. I hope that my projects will serve as strong evidence of my ability to create responsive and appealing websites.
I aim to find a job where I can continue to grow as a programmer, acquire new skills, and work within a team that values innovation and quality. As a Junior Frontend Developer, I am eager to learn and ready to take on challenges to constantly improve in this field.
I am grateful for the opportunity to utilize GitHub as a platform to present my projects and share my code. I hope that this initiative will help me capture the attention of potential employers and provide me with the chance to demonstrate my potential as a developer.
I am open to new opportunities and invitations for interviews. I would love to join a team that supports the professional growth of its members and creates innovative and satisfying projects.
In this project, I used the following languages: HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, along with the Chart.js and Bootstrap libraries. By combining these languages and libraries, I was able to create a dynamic and visually appealing web project that effectively presents and visualizes data using Chart.js, while leveraging the responsive design capabilities of Bootstrap.
